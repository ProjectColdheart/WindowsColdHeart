# WindowsColdHeart
The Windows version of the Coldheart framework. Should work on windows versions 7 and above with python version 2.7.
Tested: Win7 - Working

This is the project Coldheart. This framework is a replacement for the NSA's execution environment 'Fuzzbunch' and 
written in Python 2.7. The main purpose of Coldheart is to quickly, easily, and effectively run operations similar to 
those ran in fuzzbunch. For those who don't know, fuzzbunch contains a wide range of exploits and other things (credit: NSA).
Currently Coldheart only supports two exploits: Eternalblue, and Doublepulsar (used to hack windows machines) and a 
few 'touch' programs for information gathering. More exploits to be added soon.

*IMPORTANT* If you try and run the script and it instantly closes or says 'No module named pip', please install pip first.
